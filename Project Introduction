Introduction 

The idea behind this project is to explore the neighborhoods in Toronto for their liveability. A neighborhood may be categorized based on the venues, 
crime rate, population demographics like total count, immigrations, healthy food index, and other parameters like number of rented vs owned dwellings, 
average income or average rent. The stakeholders include anyone interested in learning about the neighborhoods not only for liveability ut also to 
understand the business potential of the town. In this project the focus is on understanding the potential of choosing an area of residence.

Business Problem
Can we determine the attractiveness of a neighborhoods (top 10) based on the venues, lower crime rates, number of rented dwellings, average rent, etc?
